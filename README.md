Part 1
=================
I preserved the font-sizes and margins that were already applied but changed the colors, fonts, backgrounds, etc.

## Changes
- Added a noisy background image with a orangish tinge. The image was genrated using:
https://www.cssmatic.com/noise-texture
- Added an inset box-shadow to create the vignette effect sort of how like a scroll looks brighter towards the middle
- Added the 'Beth Allen' font to all paragraphs
- Added the 'Caveat' font to all header tags and text within divs
- Added a container/div around all the content but within the body so the body can stretch to fit window and apply the
background/vingette on the entire page
- Added padding to the top of the body so that the header margin doesn't push the body down
- Updated link colors
- Added rounded corners and bottom + right side box shadow to images
