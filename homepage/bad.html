                    <p class="simple-margin">
                        I am a professional armwrestler from the United States. I was born July 15, 1964 and
                        started my professional armwrestling career in 1982 at the age of 18. When I am not
                        arm wrestling you can find me at my job working as a mechanic for Delta Air Lines.
                        Some of my nicknames include "The Giant Crusher", "Superman", and the "Perfect Storm".

                <p class="simple-margin">
                    Since my first world title in 1983 I have won four world championships in the heavyweight
                    division, and the middleweight world championship. Some notable tournaments I have won
                    include the USAA National Pro-Am (1996-2010), Reno Reunion (1999-2006), Arnold classic
                    (2006-2007), and the AAA Stand-Up National (1984-1990). I have dozens of championship titles
                    on both the left and right arm.

                    If hired you can expect world-class coaching and training. I have trained hundreds of
                    armwrestlers many of whom went on to become world-class armwrestlers themselves. I am
                    always 100% committed to perfecting the art of armwrestling so you can expect a masterclass
                    that includes all of the modern armwrestling techniques and metas.
